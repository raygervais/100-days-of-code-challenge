# Week 1

## Day 1

`Python`: Created a somewhat more complicated Hello World, which asks for the users name via a
function call prior to printing their name. A nice little start while getting lessons and
environments set up.

`BASH`: Created the folder structure script which will help to automate making folders and
readme's for the following weeks. Was nice to brush up on very basic bash scripting for
the first day as well.
